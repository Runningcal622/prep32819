          For displaying exponential growths in an easily readible manner you can use a
          Logarithmic scale. This reduces exponential growth into linear growth. People see
          lines much better than exponentials.

          Another way to help visualize the data is to use indexes. By visualizing
          the indecies it allows the viewer to understand a series of datas. They can use the
          indecies to understand how the data is trending.

          Sometimes line graphs include a lot of volatility, making them hard to understand
          and see trends. One way to make this better is to use a trend line that follows the
          behavior of the graph, but uses a running average to smooth out the jags. Without the
          random peaks and valleys the relationship and stoty you are trying to tell is made easier.
